Once again, it is the time for revamping the realization. It happens to everyone, specially who tends to think and question at the back of their mind. For them, who has a tendency to raise her hand in the class first, to ask first; it is for them, who sees with doubt, who is a believer of non-beliver at first, reading is the only solution for you. 
Cinema,documentary and television, is a great source of information but with book, you won the last war. While reading you get so much space around you, where you spread your wings of imigation without any boundaries and ask question to every single line, where you can not quite connect the dots. Your reading moves you, make you flow with the wind and pave the path to sway with bouncy ups and down but your feets stays on the ground. You know, where is this leading. Your consience is aware. Your sharp logic sparkles and at the end you completely disbiefe with the content but you still feel the pleasure of ethereal journey. You are not putting you in the darkness, you are not creating hole and confining youselft into the stream of directed metaphore rather you just surrender yourself in the alter of your possibilities.
